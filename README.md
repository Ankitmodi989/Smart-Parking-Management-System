# Smart Parking Management System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Parking Management System (SPMS)** is an end-to-end software solution designed to automate parking space discovery, slot reservation, vehicle entry/exit monitoring, fee calculation, and payment processing. Built as a Software Engineering course project (CS311L) at KIET Deemed to be University, SPMS addresses urban traffic congestion and parking inefficiencies by delivering real-time visibility and centralized management.

The system connects drivers with available parking facilities through a responsive interface, while providing administrators with a powerful dashboard to control slot inventory, configure dynamic pricing, and monitor occupancy and revenue metrics.

## Problem Statement

Traditional manual parking management relies on physical attendants, paper tickets, and guesswork. Drivers waste significant time searching for open slots, causing congestion around parking venues, fuel wastage, and frustration. Facilities suffer from underutilized capacity, lack of real-time occupancy visibility, manual billing errors, and revenue leakage.

---

## Objectives

- **Automate Parking Management**: Eliminate manual ticketing and manual slot allocation.
- **Provide Real-Time Availability**: Give drivers instant visibility into available parking slots.
- **Enable Advance Reservations**: Allow drivers to search, reserve, and pay for parking slots in advance.
- **Automate Entry/Exit Detection**: Integrate IoT sensors / ANPR camera events for seamless vehicle check-in and check-out.
- **Streamline Billing & Payments**: Automatically calculate fees based on duration and process payments via digital gateways.
- **Deliver Admin Analytics**: Provide facility administrators with detailed occupancy, revenue, and statistical reports.

---

## System Actors

- **Driver**: Primary user who searches, reserves, pays for, and utilizes parking slots.
- **Admin**: System manager who configures parking facilities, pricing, and monitors reports.
- **Sensor / Camera (IoT/ANPR)**: External hardware or simulated interface detecting vehicle entry and exit events.
- **Payment Gateway**: External payment service processing credit/debit card and digital wallet transactions.
